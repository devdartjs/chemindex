# 🔹 Chemindex API

A free API-driven system for managing chemical reagents and user access, designed to streamline inventory management in resource-constrained Science laboratories in South America. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, ChemIndex offers a modular and fully documentated role-based authenticated system access control (**Swagger**).

## Note on Legacy Frontend Files

The remote repository includes `views`, `HTML`, and `CSS` files, which are no longer actively used in the backend. These files represent the initial frontend implementation (using view enginer) and are retained for historical reference, showcasing the project's early development. The corresponding frontend was developed separately using **React** and **Vite** and will be hosted on a distinct domain.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** + **Express.js** for backend.
- **MongoDB** for NoSQL database with **mongoose** as ODM.
- **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication.
- **Swagger UI + YAML** for API documentation.
- **Jest** for unit and integration tests.
- **Docker** + **DockerHub** for containerization.
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline.
- **Custom middlewares** for security, input sanitation, and access control.
